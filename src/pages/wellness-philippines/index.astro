        <p>Wellness in the Philippines surprised me. I expected the beach massages and resort spas, but I didn't expect the depth of it — hilot practitioners who can feel where your stress lives, volcanic hot springs where the water fizzes on your skin, and a boxing culture so embedded in the national identity that an entire country stops to watch one man fight. Jenice grew up with hilot as basic healthcare — when someone was sick, the manghihilot came before the doctor. The Philippines doesn't market itself as a wellness destination the way Bali or Thailand does, but the traditions run deeper and the prices make it accessible to everyone.</p>

      <div class="well-protips-card">
        <h2 class="well-protips-heading">Scott's Pro Tips</h2>
        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best Value Massage:</strong> Skip the resort spa and find a local hilot practitioner — you'll pay ₱150–300 ($2.65–5.30 USD) for a treatment that's often better than the ₱2,000+ resort version. Ask your hotel front desk or any local — everyone knows someone who does hilot.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Springs Timing:</strong> Go to Laguna hot springs on weekdays — prices drop 30–50% and you'll have the pools to yourself. Weekend rates spike and popular villas book out weeks in advance. Arrive early (before 10am) for the quietest experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Boxing Gym Etiquette:</strong> Bring your own hand wraps and gloves if you have them — gym rental gloves have seen better days. Wear proper athletic shoes (no slippers). Be respectful to the trainers — call them "coach" and listen. A ₱100–200 tip ($1.75–3.50 USD) after a good session is appreciated.</li>
            <li><strong>Arnis Souvenirs:</strong> Buy your rattan sticks in the Philippines — ₱100–200 per pair at martial arts shops near training centers. They're allowed in checked luggage (not carry-on). Wrap them in a towel inside your bag. Customs won't care — they're sporting equipment, not weapons.</li>
            <li><strong>Gym Membership Hack:</strong> If you're staying 2+ weeks, a monthly gym membership (₱1,500–3,000 / $26.50–53 USD) is cheaper than daily drop-ins. Most gyms offer monthly passes without contracts. Anytime Fitness locations honor international memberships.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration Is Everything:</strong> Whether you're in a hot spring, a boxing gym, or doing beach yoga, the tropical heat will dehydrate you faster than you think. Drink 3–4 liters of water daily minimum. Electrolyte packets are cheap at any pharmacy — ₱15–25 ($0.25–0.45 USD) per sachet. Coconut water (buko juice) is ₱20–50 ($0.35–0.90 USD) fresh from the vendor.</li>
            <li><strong>Retreat Booking:</strong> Book wellness retreats directly through the resort website — third-party booking sites mark up 15–25%. For The Farm at San Benito and Nay Palad, book 2–3 months in advance during peak season (Dec–May). Off-season rates (June–November) can be 30–40% lower with the same experience.</li>

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "What is hilot massage in the Philippines?", answer: "Hilot is a traditional Filipino healing massage that uses coconut oil, banana leaves, and pressure techniques passed down through generations. Practitioners (manghihilot) diagnose tension by feeling for 'displaced' muscles and joints, then use deep-tissue manipulation to realign them. Sessions cost ₱300-800 ($5-14 USD) and are available at spas, resorts, and from local practitioners in most towns." },
    { question: "Where are the best hot springs in the Philippines?", answer: "Laguna province has the highest concentration — Pansol in Calamba has hundreds of private hot spring resorts within a 30-minute drive from Manila. Asin Hot Springs near Baguio offers mountain-fed thermal pools. Mainit Hot Springs in Camiguin sits right next to a cold river for contrast bathing. Tagaytay's spas offer heated pools with volcano views. Budget ₱200-1,500 ($4-27 USD) for day access." },
    { question: "Can tourists train boxing in the Philippines?", answer: "Absolutely — the Philippines is a boxing-obsessed nation and gyms welcome visitors. Elorde Boxing Gym has branches across Manila with drop-in rates of ₱300-500 ($5-9 USD) per session. Baguio has altitude training camps. Some gyms offer one-on-one pad work with trainers for ₱500-1,000 per hour. Bring your own hand wraps; gloves are usually provided." },
    { question: "What is arnis and where can I learn it?", answer: "Arnis (also called Eskrima or Kali) is the national martial art of the Philippines — a weapons-based system using sticks, knives, and empty-hand techniques. It became an Olympic sport in 2021. Training is available in Manila (Doce Pares, Balintawak clubs), Cebu (the birthplace of Eskrima), and Baguio. Drop-in sessions cost ₱200-500 ($4-9 USD)." },
    { question: "How much does a spa day cost in the Philippines?", answer: "A full-body massage starts at ₱300 ($5 USD) at local spas and goes up to ₱3,000+ ($54 USD) at luxury resort spas. A full spa day with massage, facial, body scrub, and pool access typically costs ₱1,500-5,000 ($27-90 USD). The Philippines offers some of the best value spa experiences in Southeast Asia — quality is high and prices are a fraction of Western rates." },
    { question: "What are the best wellness retreats in the Philippines?", answer: "The Farm at San Benito (Batangas) is the top luxury wellness resort with medical-grade detox programs. Nurture Wellness Village (Tagaytay) offers holistic treatments in a garden setting. Atmosphere Resorts (Dumaguete) combines diving with spa culture. For budget wellness, Sagada's mountain air and yoga studios offer a DIY retreat atmosphere. Retreat packages range from ₱5,000-50,000 ($90-900 USD) per night." },
