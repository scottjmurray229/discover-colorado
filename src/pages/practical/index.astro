Hotels will ask for your passport at check-in, but after that it should stay locked up. Some domestic flights require a valid ID, so carry your passport on inter-island travel days only.' },

      { label: 'Global Entry / SENTRI', text: 'If you\'re a US citizen, get Global Entry or a SENTRI pass before your trip — it\'s about $120 for five years and worth every penny. We got ours living in SoCal for the Mexico border crossings, but the real payoff is coming home through NAIA or any international airport. After 20+ hours of travel, three or four jumbo jets land at the same time and the immigration line is massive. Global Entry gets you through in minutes instead of an hour-plus. It pays for itself after two trips.' },

Some US banks reimburse ATM fees — I use a Fidelity Cash Management card exclusively over there and never pay a fee.' },
      { label: 'Split Your Cards', text: 'ALWAYS bring two or three ATM cards and credit cards on your trip. Only carry one of each when you go out — keep the backups locked in your hotel safe. The Philippines is very safe, but things fall out of pockets, bags get left behind, and if you lose your only card, your trip is over. We learned this the hard way.' },
      { label: 'Cash Is King', text: 'Outside Manila, Cebu, and major tourist hubs, many restaurants, tricycles, markets, and guesthouses are cash-only. Always carry enough pesos to cover 2–3 days of expenses, especially on islands and in rural areas.' },

      { label: 'Tricycles & Habal-Habal', text: 'Tricycles (motorcycle with sidecar) are the local taxi — ₱20–50 ($0.35–0.90 USD) for short rides, more for longer distances. Habal-habal (motorcycle taxis) are common on smaller islands. Always agree on the price before getting on.' },
      { label: 'Grab (Ride-Hailing)', text: 'Download the Grab app before your trip and add your international credit card when you land. Grab works well in Clark, Angeles City, and most of Luzon, plus Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, and Bacolod — metered fares, no haggling, air-conditioned cars. It\'s the safest and most predictable option for city transport. Not available in smaller towns.' },
      { label: 'Scooter & Car Rental', text: 'Available in most tourist areas for ₱300–500/day ($5–9 USD) for scooters, more for cars. An international driving permit (IDP) is technically required. Helmets are mandatory. Roads can be rough and unpredictable — only rent a scooter if you\'re an experienced rider. Important: rental shops may ask to hold your passport as a deposit — never hand it over. Offer a photocopy instead and walk away if they insist. They almost always come running after you. Your passport stays in the hotel safe, always.' },

Calls are usually $0.20/minute, but don\'t call anyone unless it\'s an emergency. Install WhatsApp and Viber before your trip — that\'s how Filipinos communicate and how you\'ll message hotels, tour operators, and drivers.' },
      { label: 'eSIM & Local SIMs', text: 'Most newer phones are eSIM only, so you can\'t pop in a physical SIM anyway. If your carrier doesn\'t cover the Philippines, grab a Globe or Smart eSIM through their app or buy a tourist SIM at NAIA or Mactan airport for ₱300–500 ($5–9 USD) with 10–15 GB of data. SIM registration requires your passport.' },
      { label: 'Data Coverage', text: '4G/LTE works in most cities and tourist areas. 5G is limited to Metro Manila. Globe has better coverage in tourist areas; Smart is stronger in rural and remote areas. Load up via GCash, convenience stores, or the carrier\'s app — packages run ₱50–299 ($1–5 USD) for 2–10 GB.' },
      { label: 'WiFi Reliability', text: 'Hotel and cafe WiFi is generally usable in cities and major tourist areas (5–20 Mbps). Remote islands and mountain towns can be slow or unavailable.

We\'ve thankfully never had to file a claim, but having it is peace of mind every time we board that plane.' },
      { label: 'Tap Water', text: 'Don\'t drink tap water anywhere in the Philippines. Bottled water costs ₱15–25 ($0.25–0.45 USD) and is available everywhere. Ice in restaurants is usually purified (tubular or hollow ice is safe; irregular chunks may not be).' },
      { label: 'Hospitals & Clinics', text: 'Major cities have quality private hospitals: Makati Medical Center and St. Luke\'s (Manila), Chong Hua (Cebu), Davao Doctors Hospital (Davao). Smaller islands may only have basic rural health units — another reason for medevac insurance.' },
      { label: 'Dengue & Mosquitoes', text: 'Dengue is present year-round, especially during rainy season (Jun–Nov). Use mosquito repellent with DEET, wear long sleeves at dusk, and choose accommodation with screens or air conditioning. No vaccine is widely recommended for travelers.' },

Monitor weather via PAGASA (weather.gov.ph) and airline alerts. Flights and ferries get cancelled — always have buffer days.' },
      { label: 'General Safety', text: 'The Philippines is generally safe for tourists. Use common sense: avoid flashing expensive items, don\'t walk alone in unfamiliar areas at night, and keep valuables in a hotel safe. Petty theft (pickpocketing) is the main risk in crowded areas.' },

You\'ll use this every single day.' },

Your phone chargers and laptops are dual-voltage and will work fine. Do NOT bring any appliances — I plugged in a Keurig and it popped the circuit breaker instantly. Hair dryers, curling irons, and anything with a heating element will fry unless it\'s rated 110–240V.

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "Do I need a visa to visit the Philippines?", answer: "Most nationalities get a free 30-day visa on arrival — no application needed. This includes US, UK, EU, Canadian, Australian, and Japanese passport holders. You can extend up to 36 months at any Bureau of Immigration office (₱3,000-4,000 per month extension). Bring a return or onward ticket — immigration may ask for proof of departure." },
    { question: "Is the Philippines safe for tourists?", answer: "The Philippines is generally safe for tourists in popular destinations. Petty theft (pickpocketing, bag-snatching) is the main risk in cities like Manila and Cebu. Avoid the western Mindanao conflict zones (Marawi, Sulu, Basilan). Use common sense: don't flash expensive items, take registered taxis or Grab, and avoid walking alone at night in unfamiliar areas. Tourist areas are well-policed." },
    { question: "How much money should I bring to the Philippines?", answer: "Budget travelers: $30-50/day covers hostels, local food, and transport. Mid-range: $80-150/day for hotels, restaurants, and activities. Luxury: $200+/day for resorts and private tours. Bring US dollars or withdraw pesos from ATMs (BDO, BPI have the best rates). Notify your bank before traveling. Cash is king outside Manila — many places don't accept cards." },
    { question: "Can I use my credit card in the Philippines?", answer: "Credit cards are accepted at hotels, malls, and upscale restaurants in major cities. However, most local restaurants, markets, tricycles, ferries, and small businesses are cash-only. Always carry ₱2,000-5,000 in cash. Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted where cards work; Amex is less common. ATM withdrawal limits are typically ₱10,000-20,000 per transaction." },
    { question: "What is the best way to get around the Philippines?", answer: "Between islands: domestic flights (Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines) or ferries (2GO, FastCat). Within cities: Grab (ride-hailing app), jeepneys (₱13 minimum), and tricycles (₱20-100). For island-hopping: bangka boats hired at the port. Between nearby cities: buses and vans. Renting a scooter costs ₱300-500/day and works well on smaller islands like Siargao and Siquijor." },
    { question: "Do I need a SIM card for the Philippines?", answer: "Yes — a local SIM card is essential. Globe and Smart are the two providers. Buy a SIM at the airport for ₱40-100 ($0.70-$2) and load data packages: ₱99 for 2GB/7 days or ₱299 for 8GB/30 days. 5G coverage exists in Metro Manila and Cebu; 4G is widespread in tourist areas. Remote islands and mountain towns may have spotty coverage." },
