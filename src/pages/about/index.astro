    <h1>Two Worlds, One Love for <em>the Philippines</em></h1>
    <p class="hero-intro">We're Scott and Jenice — an American who got his first passport in 2002 because one of his best friends said "you need to see this place," and a Filipina who grew up in Mabalacat watching for the <em>Belén</em> every Christmas and being shaped by a grandmother who taught her how to see the world. That first trip in 2003 sparked 20+ return trips and 40+ countries of travel, but the Philippines has always been the first love. This is how a Yahoo Messenger chat became a marriage, and how two decades of obsessive trip planning became the travel guide we wished existed.</p>

    <p class="letter-text">Travel has always been my escape from the rat race — and honestly, I enjoy the <strong>planning</strong> almost as much as being there. Researching destinations, mapping routes, finding that perfect beach town. It all started at a travel agency in LA where we'd get cheap tickets to fly LAX to Clark. One of my best friends had a web design business with a partner in the Philippines and told me I needed to get a passport and come see it for myself. I'd never left the country. In February 2003, I landed in Boracay — White Beach before the world discovered it — and the Philippines addiction began.<br><br>I went back in 2004 and met Jenice. We started as Yahoo Messenger chatmates. That friendship turned into a relationship, and that relationship turned into a life built around exploring her home country together. Since then I've made 20+ trips across nearly every province outside of Mindanao — Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor, Palawan, Dumaguete, and dozens more. Davao, Samal Island, and the rest of Mindanao are still on the list. I've watched Clark Airport go from a terminal with no AC to a modern international hub. I've taken the NLEX to Manila more times than I can count. I've watched Grab replace the taxis that never once ran their meters for me.<br><br><strong>I'm not a travel blogger. I work in healthcare IT.</strong> But the Philippines keeps pulling me back, and I finally decided to put everything I've learned into something useful — a site with real local knowledge, honest prices, video content from the places we've actually been, and an AI trip planner that builds itineraries from our 50 combined years of experience. It's the resource my friend and I talked about building 20 years ago. It just took this long to figure out how.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="letter-block">
    <div class="letter-attr">Jenice <span class="attr-role">· Filipina · Born in Bulacan, raised in Pampanga</span></div>
    <p class="letter-text">I was fortunate enough to be born in a country with over 7,000 islands. Growing up, I was so appreciative of the close-knit relationships that come with Filipino culture — extended families everywhere, uncles and aunties and cousins, where you develop friendships and appreciate what those relationships offer in your growth. My grandmother was very influential in my life. She shaped how I saw things at an early age.<br><br>Part of my upbringing was celebrating fiestas and holidays. Christmas is the biggest and longest-celebrated holiday in the country. As a child, I was always looking forward to the <em>Belén</em> — it would signal the beginning of the long holiday celebration. What it meant to me: new clothes, lots of food on the table, going around the neighborhood to visit each house, attending church masses. <strong>That sense of community isn't something you read about in a guidebook. It's something you grow up inside of.</strong><br><br>If there are three things I would highlight about the Philippines, it's the people, the culture, and the love for food. Filipinos are known for their warm hospitality — they are so open about sharing their country with foreigners. As a first-time traveler, you can feel it immediately. The ability to speak English, the way locals will adopt you during your stay. The culture is family-oriented but it extends beyond family — even strangers who visit for the first time are welcomed with open hands. We have this sense of respect: we don't go by first-name basis, we call you <em>ate</em> or <em>kuya</em>. If I were a stranger who received that kind of treatment, I would definitely come back.<br><br>And the food — at any given time of day, it doesn't matter where you are: the airport, a side street, the mall, a park — you will see at least one Filipino holding something, eating or munching. That's who we are. <strong>Scott has the travel planning obsession and the technical skills. I have a lifetime of actually living it.</strong> My friends and family across the provinces are the real source behind our recommendations. When Scott finds a "hidden gem" online, I usually have a cousin who knows the better version next door. Together, we want you to experience the Philippines the way we do — not the Instagram version, but the real one.</p>
