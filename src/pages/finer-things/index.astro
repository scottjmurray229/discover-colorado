Rooms start around $1,200/night in peak season and climb steeply from there. The on-site restaurant <strong>Element 47</strong> has one of the best wine programs in the state. The ski concierge will have your boots warmed and gear ready before you finish breakfast. If you\'re going to splurge on one Colorado ski trip, this is where the money goes.' },

The lobby alone — soaring ceilings, stone fireplaces, and Remington bronze sculptures — sets the tone. Rooms from $800–2,000/night depending on season. The <strong>Remède Spa</strong> is a 15,000-square-foot retreat with an oxygen lounge (altitude recovery is real at 7,900 feet). Butler service and a heated outdoor pool with mountain views seal the deal.' },

In summer, this becomes a base for mountain biking, fly fishing, and hiking the alpine meadows.' },

Wait, We\'re in Colorado', text: 'Colorado doesn\'t need Utah\'s resorts — the state has its own collection of world-class mountain hotels. <strong>The Sebastian</strong> in Vail, <strong>Hotel Jerome</strong> in Aspen (since 1889), <strong>Lumière Hotel</strong> in Telluride, and <strong>The Limelight</strong> in Snowmass all deliver luxury without the pretension. Colorado ski culture is upscale but unpretentious — nobody looks twice at your gear brand, but everyone notices if you can ski Highlands Bowl.' },
      { label: 'Telluride Boutique Hotels', link: '/destinations/telluride/', text: 'Telluride does luxury differently — smaller, more intimate, with a mountain-town soul. <strong>The Madeline Hotel & Residences</strong> is the flagship: ski-in/ski-out, full spa, and a rooftop pool. <strong>Hotel Telluride</strong> is a boutique option with rooms from $300–800/night and a quieter vibe. The free gondola between town and Mountain Village means you can stay in town for the nightlife and ski from the Village. That gondola is one of the best free rides in American skiing.' },

James Beard Award-winning chef Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson and master sommelier Bobby Stuckey created something special here. The tasting menu runs $150–200/person before wine. Reservations book weeks out. The wine list is deep on Italian and Colorado selections — yes, Colorado wine is a real thing. This is the best restaurant in the state, full stop.' },

No signage, no menu posted online — you get what chef Duncan Holmes is inspired by that night. 10–12 courses for around $200/person. The space is intimate, the plating is meticulous, and the ingredient sourcing is hyper-local. This is Denver\'s answer to the omakase trend, except it\'s New American with Colorado ingredients. Book well in advance.' },
      { label: 'The Wolf\'s Tailor, Denver', link: '/destinations/denver/', text: 'Grain-forward cooking that sounds odd until you taste it. House-milled flours, fermented grains, and pasta made from heritage wheats grown in Colorado. Dinner runs $100–150/person. The bread program alone is worth the visit — they mill grains daily. It\'s creative and intellectual without being pretentious. Located in Sunnyside, which has quietly become one of Denver\'s best dining neighborhoods.' },

The black cod miso is the signature (just like every Nobu), but the Aspen location has specials you won\'t find elsewhere. Dinner for two runs $200–400 depending on how deep you go. The atmosphere is Aspen at its best — celebrities and ski bums at adjacent tables, nobody caring who\'s who. Reservations essential in ski season.' },
      { label: 'Splendido at The Chateau, Beaver Creek', link: '/destinations/vail/', text: 'Fine dining in a European-style chateau at the base of Beaver Creek. The elk tenderloin is a Colorado icon. Dinner runs $80–150/person. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook the slopes. In winter, you can literally ski to dinner — the restaurant is at the base of the Centennial lift. The wine cellar holds 10,000+ bottles. It\'s the kind of place where ski jackets are welcome alongside sport coats.' },

The concept: farm-to-table before it was a buzzword, with Colorado-sourced ingredients and a warm, communal atmosphere. Dinner runs $60–100/person. The brunch is legendary in Boulder. Multiple locations now, but the Boulder flagship on Pearl Street has the original energy — sit on the patio and watch the Flatirons turn gold at sunset.' },

Day passes from $30. The resort itself is mid-range, but the <strong>Spa of the Rockies</strong> on-site offers premium treatments: hot stone massage ($175), mineral body wraps, and a private vapor cave experience. The pool stays open year-round, and soaking under falling snow with steam rising off the water is a core Colorado experience.' },

Natural stone pools built into the hillside, temperatures ranging from 101\u00B0F to 104\u00B0F, fed by natural mineral springs. Day admission $20. After dark, it\'s adults-only and clothing-optional — the stars above the Yampa Valley are extraordinary. No cell service, no bright lights, no noise. Getting there in winter requires 4WD or the shuttle ($15 round trip). This is Colorado\'s most authentic hot springs experience.' },
      { label: 'The Springs Resort, Pagosa Springs', text: 'The deepest geothermal hot spring in the world, feeding 25 soaking pools ranging from 83\u00B0F to 114\u00B0F along the San Juan River. The resort rooms start at $300/night and include unlimited pool access. The <strong>spa</strong> uses geothermal mineral water in treatments. Sunset soaks with views of the San Juan Mountains are unforgettable. Less crowded than Glenwood, more polished than Strawberry Park — the sweet spot for luxury hot springs.' },
      { label: 'Iron Mountain Hot Springs, Glenwood Springs', link: '/destinations/glenwood-springs/', text: 'The newer, more boutique alternative to the main Glenwood pool. Sixteen freshwater soaking pools and a large family pool along the Colorado River. Day passes $35. The pools are terraced on the riverbank with individual temperature controls — find your sweet spot. A full bar serves drinks poolside. It\'s more intimate and upscale than the main resort, and the river views are better. Evening sessions under the stars are the move.' },
      { label: 'Dunton Hot Springs', text: 'A restored ghost town turned ultra-luxury resort in the San Juan Mountains — this is Colorado\'s most exclusive hot springs experience. Hand-hewn log cabins, a saloon, a chapel, and natural hot springs. Rates start around $1,500/night all-inclusive. Limited to 42 guests at a time. The spring-fed pool sits in a restored bathhouse from the 1800s. If money is no object and you want complete privacy in the mountains, Dunton is it.' },

A 30-minute flight runs $350–500/person; hour-long tours covering Maroon Bells and the Elk Mountains run $700–1,000. Some operators offer heli-skiing packages in winter — you land on untouched powder above treeline and ski down. That\'s a $1,500+ day, but if you\'re an expert skier, it\'s the ultimate Colorado flex.' },

The <strong>Vista Dome</strong> class ($75/person) has a glass-topped car for panoramic views. <strong>First Class Lunch</strong> ($125/person) adds a multi-course meal with Colorado wine pairings. The 2-hour round trip from Ca\u00F1on City is scenic in any season, but fall colors in September are extraordinary. Book the dome car — the standard coach is fine, but you came for the views.' },

Green fees $200–350. <strong>Red Sky Golf Club</strong> in Vail Valley has a Tom Fazio and Greg Norman course at 7,500 feet elevation. Green fees $250–400. At altitude, the ball flies 10–15% farther — club down and enjoy the extra distance. Season runs May through October.' },
      { label: 'Private Fly Fishing Experiences', text: 'Colorado has 9,000+ miles of trout streams, and the premium guided experiences are special. <strong>Eleven Mile Canyon</strong>, the <strong>Frying Pan River</strong> near Basalt, and the <strong>South Platte</strong> are legendary. A full-day private guide runs $500–700 for two people, including gear, streamside lunch, and local knowledge that took decades to build. The gold medal waters designation means these rivers sustain high populations of large trout — 14-inch rainbows and browns are common.' },
      { label: 'Maroon Bells Luxury Experiences', text: 'The most photographed peaks in North America — and they live up to it. Standard access is $10 by reservation shuttle. But the premium move: book a sunrise photography tour ($200–300/person) that gets you in before the shuttle starts. Or hire a private guide for a day hike to Crater Lake ($350–500/person) with packed gourmet lunch. In winter, cross-country ski or snowshoe to the bells on a guided tour. The reflection of the Maroon Bells in Maroon Lake at dawn is genuinely breathtaking.' },

Start at <strong>Bookcliff Vineyards</strong> for the Ensemble red blend, hit <strong>Plum Creek Winery</strong> for the Palisade Peach wine (don\'t judge it by the name — it\'s genuinely good), and finish at <strong>Mesa Park Vineyards</strong> for estate-grown Cabernet. Full-day guided tours with transport run $100–150/person. Pair with a lunch at <strong>Palisade Cafe</strong> — the peach pork chop is the move.' },

Distillery tours run $15–25.' },

Several Palisade wineries offer <strong>harvest experiences</strong> in September — you pick grapes, help crush, and taste barrel samples. These run $100–200/person and sell out fast.' },

Drink extra water, limit alcohol the first day, and don\'t plan strenuous activity for your first 24 hours. The St. Regis Aspen has an oxygen lounge for a reason.

Go to Palisade with an open mind and you\'ll come home with a case.' },
      { label: 'What\'s the dress code at Colorado\'s fine restaurants?', text: 'Colorado fine dining is smart casual — nicer jeans, a collared shirt or blouse, and clean shoes will get you into 95% of upscale restaurants. The Penrose Room at The Broadmoor requires a jacket. Everywhere else, the vibe is "elevated mountain" — you won\'t see ties, but you won\'t see flip-flops either. Aspen and Vail skew slightly dressier than Denver, but nobody\'s turning you away in a nice sweater.' },

        <p>Colorado is one of those places where luxury doesn't mean stuffy. You can ski world-class powder in the morning, soak in a natural hot spring at sunset, and eat a James Beard-caliber meal that night — all in the same mountain town. I've traveled all over, and the combination of outdoor adventure and elevated experiences here is hard to beat anywhere. The altitude hits you harder than the cocktails, but that's part of the deal.

Drink twice the water you normally would, skip the heavy drinking on night one, and don't plan a 14er hike for your first day. Most luxury hotels offer supplemental oxygen for $50–100/night — use it if you need it.</li>
            <li><strong>Ski Season Pricing:</strong> Peak ski season (Christmas through Presidents' Day) commands premium rates at every mountain resort. For the same luxury at 30–40% less: book early December or late March/April for spring skiing. The snow is still excellent and the crowds thin out dramatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Reservations Are Essential:</strong> Denver's top restaurants (Beckon, Frasca, Wolf's Tailor) book up 2–4 weeks ahead. Mountain-town fine dining during ski season books even faster. Make dinner reservations before you book your flights. Same goes for hot springs — Strawberry Park and Dunton Hot Springs require reservations, especially on weekends.</li>
            <li><strong>Layers Over Luxury:</strong> Colorado weather changes fast — a 60-degree morning can turn into a 30-degree snowstorm by afternoon. Pack layers regardless of season. A $2,000 cashmere coat is useless if you don't have a wind shell over it at 12,000 feet. The smartest dressed people in Aspen are wearing Patagonia, not Prada.</li>
            <li><strong>Wine Country Timing:</strong> Palisade wine tasting is best May through October. September harvest season is the premium window — some wineries offer crush experiences. Bring a cooler for your wine purchases; summer heat in the car will cook a bottle fast. Many wineries are closed or limited hours November through April.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Springs Strategy:</strong> Go early morning or late evening to avoid crowds. Strawberry Park after dark (adults only) is the quintessential Colorado hot springs experience — but you need 4WD or the shuttle in winter. Iron Mountain in Glenwood Springs is the best mix of upscale atmosphere and natural setting. Dunton Hot Springs is the ultimate splurge if money is truly no object.</li>
