Vail is synonymous with big skiing — its 5,317 acres make it one of the largest single-mountain ski resorts in North America, and the legendary Back Bowls offer over 3,000 acres of wide-open powder terrain that veterans return for year after year. The pedestrian Bavarian-style village at the base is a destination in itself, with restaurants like Sweet Basil and Mountain Standard serving elevated mountain cuisine, while The George bar keeps the apres-ski scene buzzing. In summer, Vail reinvents itself with the Epic Discovery adventure park, a world-class mountain biking trail network, and wildflower hikes to spots like Booth Falls and Piney River Ranch that remind you why people fall in love with the Colorado high country.
