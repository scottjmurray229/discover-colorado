Glenwood Springs sits at the confluence of the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers and has been drawing visitors to its steaming mineral waters since the Ute people bathed here centuries ago. The Glenwood Hot Springs Pool, stretching over 100 meters, is the world's largest natural hot springs pool and remains the town's anchor attraction, while the newer Iron Mountain Hot Springs offers a more intimate experience with 16 smaller soaking pools perched along the banks of the Colorado River. Beyond the water, Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park delivers an unusual mountaintop combination of underground cave tours and above-ground thrill rides including the Giant Canyon Swing, and the revitalized downtown along Grand Avenue is home to spots like Slope & Hatch for creative Southwestern fare and the historic Hotel Colorado, a grand 1893 landmark that once hosted Teddy Roosevelt.
