Fort Collins is where Colorado's legendary craft beer culture reaches its peak, with more than 20 breweries packed into a city of 170,000 — including heavyweights like New Belgium, Odell Brewing, and Horse & Dragon. Old Town, rumored to be Walt Disney's inspiration for Main Street USA, is a walkable grid of local boutiques, bookshops like Old Firehouse Books, and restaurants like The Welsh Rabbit Bistro. Just west of town, the Cache la Poudre River carves through a dramatic canyon perfect for fly fishing and whitewater rafting, while Horsetooth Reservoir draws locals for summer paddleboarding with the Rockies as a backdrop.
