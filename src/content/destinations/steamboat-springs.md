Steamboat Springs is the real deal — a working ranching town that happens to have a world-class ski resort, where cowboys and ski bums coexist and the snow is so consistently light and dry that the resort trademarked the term "Champagne Powder." Unlike glitzier Colorado ski towns, Steamboat keeps things authentic with its downtown Lincoln Avenue lined with Western wear shops, the F.M. Light & Sons store (open since 1905), and local favorites like Laundry Kitchen & Cocktails. The natural hot springs are a defining feature, from the rustic, clothing-optional Strawberry Park Hot Springs hidden in a wooded canyon to the family-friendly Old Town Hot Springs right downtown where you can soak after a powder day.
