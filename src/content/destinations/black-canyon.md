Black Canyon of the Gunnison is Colorado's most underrated national park — a two-billion-year-old gorge so narrow and deep that some sections receive only 33 minutes of sunlight per day, giving the canyon its name and an atmosphere of primordial drama. The Painted Wall, at 2,250 feet Colorado's tallest sheer cliff face, is striped with light-colored pegmatite veins that create a natural mural visible from the South Rim overlooks. This is not a park for casual rim-to-river hiking; descending to the Gunnison River requires scrambling down unmaintained routes with a wilderness permit, but the South Rim Road's 12 overlooks and short rim trails like the Cedar Point Nature Trail deliver the canyon's power without the commitment, and the fishing in the Gold Medal waters below is legendary for those who make the effort.
