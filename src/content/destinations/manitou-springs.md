Manitou Springs is a delightfully eccentric mountain town where Victorian architecture meets crystal shops, where artists' studios sit alongside penny arcades, and where natural mineral springs bubble up from the earth at eight public fountains you can taste for free. The town's most famous challenge is the Manitou Incline, a former railroad grade turned into a brutally steep staircase of 2,744 steps that fitness enthusiasts from around the world come to conquer. After the climb, the main drag of Manitou Avenue rewards you with spots like the Sahara Cafe for Mediterranean fare and the Manitou Brewing Company for a well-earned post-hike pint.
