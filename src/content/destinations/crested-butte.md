Crested Butte calls itself "the last great Colorado ski town," and it earns the title through sheer authenticity — this is a place where the painted Victorian buildings on Elk Avenue house real dive bars like the Wooden Nickel and funky restaurants like the Secret Stash rather than luxury boutiques. The ski area is famous for its extreme terrain, with double-diamond chutes and steep cliff bands that draw expert skiers, but it also has excellent groomed cruisers and a laid-back, locals-first vibe that bigger resorts lost decades ago. Summer may be even more spectacular, when the surrounding valleys erupt into wildflower displays so legendary that the town earned the official designation as the "Wildflower Capital of Colorado," and Trail 401 offers singletrack mountain biking through fields of lupine and columbine.
