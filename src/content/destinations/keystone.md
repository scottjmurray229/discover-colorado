Keystone is the ski resort that families and groups gravitate toward, thanks to its unique combination of three distinct peaks, Colorado's largest night skiing operation, and a base village built around a frozen lake that transforms into North America's largest outdoor ice rink each winter. The skiing spans from gentle beginner terrain at the base of Dercum Mountain to the challenging above-treeline bowls of The Outback on the resort's third peak, with the Alpenglow Stube — North America's highest fine-dining restaurant at 11,444 feet — offering a gondola-accessed culinary experience midmountain. Summer brings a quieter, more affordable side with paddleboarding on Keystone Lake, a championship golf course, and access to the extensive Summit County bike path network.
