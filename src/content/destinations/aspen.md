Aspen is the rare mountain town that manages to be both a world-class ski destination and a genuine cultural hub, hosting the Aspen Music Festival, the Aspen Ideas Festival, and the Food & Wine Classic each summer. In winter, four interconnected mountains — Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk, and Snowmass — deliver terrain for every skill level, from the legendary bump runs on Ajax to Buttermilk's terrain parks. Come summer, the town transforms into a hiking and biking paradise with the iconic Maroon Bells as the crown jewel, while restaurants like Matsuhisa (Nobu's original mountain outpost) and the historic Hotel Jerome keep the apres-everything energy alive year-round.
