Mesa Verde National Park is unlike any other place in Colorado — a UNESCO World Heritage Site protecting over 600 cliff dwellings built by the Ancestral Puebloan people between 600 and 1300 AD, tucked beneath sandstone overhangs in the rugged canyons of southwestern Colorado. Cliff Palace, the largest cliff dwelling in North America with 150 rooms and 23 kivas, is the star attraction and can be explored on ranger-guided tours that bring this ancient civilization vividly to life. The park rewards slow exploration: the Mesa Top Loop Road winds past surface sites and canyon overlooks, the Petroglyph Point Trail leads to rock art panels, and the quiet evenings at Morefield Campground — the only accommodation in the park — offer a contemplative connection to a landscape people called home for over 700 years.
