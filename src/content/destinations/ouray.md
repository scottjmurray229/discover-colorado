Ouray is a tiny gem of a town — just 1,000 residents — nestled in a natural amphitheater of 13,000-foot peaks in the San Juan Mountains, earning it the nickname "the Switzerland of America." The setting is so dramatic that simply walking down Main Street feels cinematic, with waterfalls visible from town and the scent of sulfur from the natural hot springs drifting through the air. Winter brings a unique draw: the Ouray Ice Park, the world's first public ice climbing park, fills a narrow gorge with dozens of man-made and natural ice routes attracting climbers from around the world. In summer, the Million Dollar Highway connecting Ouray to Silverton is one of the most breathtaking — and nerve-wracking — drives in America, with sheer drop-offs, tight switchbacks, and no guardrails, while the Ouray Perimeter Trail loops through wildflower meadows and past cascading waterfalls encircling the entire town.
