Durango is the kind of Colorado town that feels like it stepped out of the Old West and then decided to stick around for the craft beer and mountain biking. The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, a coal-fired steam train that has chugged through the spectacular Animas River Gorge since 1882, is the town's signature experience and one of the most scenic train rides in America. Downtown Main Avenue blends Victorian architecture with a youthful energy fueled by Fort Lewis College students — Ska Brewing anchors the local beer scene, Steamworks Brewing serves wood-fired pizzas alongside hand-crafted ales, and restaurants like Ore House and Ken & Sue's keep the dining scene punching above its weight. The town is also the gateway to Mesa Verde National Park, Purgatory ski resort, and the epic Colorado Trail.
