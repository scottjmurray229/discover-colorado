Boulder is the kind of place where trail runners share the sidewalk with Nobel laureates and where a casual lunch might mean locally sourced elk tacos at The Kitchen or a wood-fired pizza at Pizzeria Locale. Framed by the dramatic Flatirons rock formations, the city pulses with outdoor energy — from tubing down Boulder Creek in summer to snowshoeing at Brainard Lake in winter. Its Pearl Street Mall is the social heart of town, lined with independent bookstores, tea houses like the Dushanbe Teahouse (a gift from Boulder's sister city in Tajikistan), and enough farm-to-table restaurants to keep any foodie busy for weeks.
