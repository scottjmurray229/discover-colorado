Winter Park has long been Denver's favorite ski hill — close enough for a day trip, affordable enough for families, and with terrain serious enough to satisfy experts, especially on the legendary mogul runs of Mary Jane Mountain. The Winter Park Express ski train, running from Denver's Union Station through the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel directly to the resort base, is one of the most unique ski commutes in the country and a Colorado tradition since the 1940s. In summer, the Trestle Bike Park draws mountain bikers from across the region, while nearby Devil's Thumb Ranch in Tabernash offers a quieter side of the valley with horseback riding, fly fishing, and a world-class spa set against the Continental Divide.
