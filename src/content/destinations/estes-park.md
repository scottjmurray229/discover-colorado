Estes Park is the charming mountain town that serves as the eastern gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, one of the most visited national parks in the country, and it wears that role beautifully. The town's main attraction beyond the park is the Stanley Hotel, the grand 1909 Georgian Colonial that inspired Stephen King's "The Shining" and still offers ghost tours and whiskey tastings. Downtown Elkhorn Avenue is a pleasant strip of taffy shops, galleries, and restaurants like Smokin' Dave's BBQ and the Rock Inn Mountain Tavern, but the real magic is just minutes away — Trail Ridge Road climbing to 12,183 feet, the alpine lake circuit from Bear Lake, and herds of elk that wander right through town each autumn during the mesmerizing bugling season.
