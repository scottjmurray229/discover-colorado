Great Sand Dunes National Park is one of Colorado's most surreal landscapes — a massive field of towering sand dunes, the tallest in North America at 755 feet, rising improbably against the snow-capped Sangre de Cristo Mountains. There are no trails on the dunes themselves; you simply pick a direction and start climbing through the soft sand, making the experience feel wonderfully wild and unstructured. Medano Creek flows at the base of the dunes in late spring and early summer, creating a natural beach where families splash and play, while the park's designation as an International Dark Sky Park means the stargazing here — with the Milky Way arching over the dune field — is among the best in the entire state.
