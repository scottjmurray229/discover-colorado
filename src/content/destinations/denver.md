Denver sits at exactly 5,280 feet above sea level, earning its legendary nickname and offering over 300 days of sunshine each year. The city's craft beer scene is unrivaled with neighborhoods like RiNo and LoDo packed with taprooms — from Great Divide Brewing to Cerebral Brewing — while the food hall scene at places like Avanti F&B and The Source Hotel keeps the culinary energy buzzing. With the Rocky Mountain foothills visible from nearly every rooftop patio, Denver is the rare capital city where you can mountain bike at sunrise and catch a Rockies game at Coors Field by afternoon.
