Breckenridge charms visitors with its perfectly preserved Victorian Main Street — a legacy of the 1859 gold rush — painted in vibrant blues, reds, and yellows and packed with everything from ski shops to the Breckenridge Distillery, the world's highest distillery. The ski resort spreads across five peaks with terrain ranging from gentle groomers on Peak 9 to the extreme chutes of Peak 6 and the above-treeline bowls accessed by the Imperial Express, North America's highest chairlift. Summer brings a different kind of adventure, with the Quandary Peak 14er trail drawing hikers from across the state and the town's free ride bike park and gold-panning tours keeping families busy from June through September.
