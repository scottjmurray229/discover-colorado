Colorado Springs is anchored by Pikes Peak, the 14,115-foot mountain that inspired Katharine Lee Bates to write "America the Beautiful," and the city lives up to that legacy every single day. Garden of the Gods alone — a free public park where 300-million-year-old red sandstone fins jut skyward against a backdrop of snow-capped peaks — is worth the trip. But the city offers far more than scenery: the revitalized downtown around Tejon Street is home to craft breweries like Bristol Brewing and restaurants like The Warehouse, while nearby attractions like the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Training Center and the Air Force Academy add layers of history and culture.
