Telluride occupies one of the most dramatic settings in all of Colorado — a historic mining town tucked into a box canyon with 13,000-foot peaks rising on three sides and Bridal Veil Falls, the state's tallest free-falling waterfall, cascading 365 feet at the canyon's head. The free gondola connecting the town to Mountain Village is the only one of its kind in North America and offers jaw-dropping views on the 13-minute ride. Telluride punches far above its weight culturally, hosting the renowned Telluride Film Festival, Bluegrass Festival, and Blues & Brews Festival, while its restaurant scene — from the white-tablecloth Allred's at the top of the gondola to the beloved Brown Dog Pizza on Colorado Avenue — rivals towns many times its size.
