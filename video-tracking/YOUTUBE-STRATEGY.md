## Video Types

### Type 1: Destination Overview (2-4 minutes)
One per destination. The YouTube version of the destination page.

**Structure:**
1. Opening aerial shot (5-10 sec) — hero video clip
2. Quick intro: "Here's what you need to know about [destination]"
3. Getting there (15-20 sec)
4. Top 3 things to do (30-45 sec each, use immersive break clips)
5. Where to eat — 2-3 picks with prices (20-30 sec)
6. Where to stay — 2-3 picks with prices (20-30 sec)
7. Scott's top tip (10-15 sec)
8. CTA: "Full guide with prices and directions on our site — link in description"

**Editing approach:** Stock footage montage with text overlays (destination name, prices, tips). Voiceover by Scott or text-only with background music. No face cam required initially.

**Naming:** `[Destination] Travel Guide 2026 — Honest Tips & Real Prices`

### Type 2: Pillar Topic Videos (3-5 minutes)
One per pillar. Cross-destination compilations.

- "Best Snorkeling in the Philippines — 10 Spots Ranked"
- "Philippine Festival Calendar 2026 — When & Where to Go"
- "Filipino Food You HAVE to Try — A Guide by Destination"
- "WWII Philippines — Historical Sites Worth Visiting"
- "Philippines Practical Guide — SIM Cards, Money, Safety & More"

**Editing:** Compilation of clips from multiple destinations with comparison graphics.

### Type 3: YouTube Shorts (15-60 seconds)
Quick vertical clips for algorithm exposure. One per destination.

- Aerial flyover + destination name overlay + "Full guide: link in bio"
- "3 things to know about [destination]" with text overlays
- Before/after comparison (expectation vs reality)
- Food close-ups with price overlay

**Why Shorts matter for a new channel:** Shorts get pushed by the algorithm regardless of subscriber count. They're your fastest path to visibility. A single viral Short can drive thousands of profile visits. Every Short should end with "Full guide on our channel" to funnel viewers to the long-form destination videos.

### Type 4: Trip Companion Demos (1-2 minutes)
Screen recordings showing the PWA in action.

- "This App Works Offline in the Philippines" — show downloading destinations, using without signal
- "How We Built a Trip Companion for the Philippines" — behind the scenes
- "Free for Founding Explorers" — beta program promotion

## Production Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)
Start with destinations that have the most stock footage variety on Shutterstock:

1. Boracay (most coverage, highest search volume)
2. El Nido
3. Cebu
4. Siargao
5. Manila

**Per destination:** 1 overview video + 2-3 Shorts = ~15 videos in month 1.

**First upload priority:** Boracay overview — this becomes your channel trailer for non-subscribers.

### Phase 2: Expand (Month 2-3)
6. Bohol
7. Coron
8. Siquijor
9. Baguio
10. Palawan (Puerto Princesa)

Plus first pillar video: "Best Snorkeling in the Philippines"

### Phase 3: Long Tail (Month 4+)
Remaining destinations + pillar videos + Trip Companion demos.

**Publishing cadence:** 2-3 videos per week (mix of overviews and Shorts). Consistency matters more than volume for the algorithm.

## YouTube SEO for Each Video

### Title Format
`[Destination] Philippines Travel Guide 2026 | Real Prices & Honest Tips`

**Title rules:**
- Destination name first (what people search for)
- Keep under 60 characters (truncates on mobile after that)
- Include the year — people want current info
- Don't clickbait — your angle is "honest and real"

### Description Template
```

how to get there, where to eat, where to stay, and what most tourists miss.

## Growth Strategy for a New Channel (0 Subscribers)

### Month 1: Establish Presence
- **Upload 15+ videos** (5 destination overviews + 10 Shorts)
- YouTube needs content to understand what your channel is about
- Shorts are your discovery engine — the algorithm pushes them regardless of sub count
- Set up all playlists, channel layout, and branding before first upload

### Month 2-3: Build Consistency
- **2-3 uploads per week** on a consistent schedule
- Engage with comments immediately (first hour matters for algorithm)
- Post community tab updates when new written guides go live on the site
- Cross-post Shorts to Instagram Reels and TikTok (same content, wider reach)

### Month 3-6: Optimize
- Check YouTube Analytics: which videos get search impressions? Double down on those destinations
- Create "response" videos to trending Philippines travel searches
- Collaborate with Filipino travel creators (comment on their videos first, build relationship)
- Target **1,000 subscribers + 4,000 watch hours** (YouTube Partner Program threshold)

### What NOT to do
- Don't buy subscribers or use sub-for-sub schemes
- Don't upload inconsistently (3 videos one week, nothing for a month)
- Don't ignore Shorts — they're the fastest growth lever for new channels
- Don't use the @scottmurray8876 personal channel for any Discover Philippines content

## Metrics to Track

Check YouTube Studio > Analytics weekly:

- **Views per video** — which destinations get the most interest

- **Traffic sources** — YouTube search vs Shorts feed vs suggested videos
- **Click-through to site** — use UTM links, check in Google Analytics or Cloudflare Analytics
- **Subscriber growth** — milestone: 1,000 subs (monetization eligibility)
- **Search impressions** — are videos appearing for "[destination] Philippines" queries
- **Shorts performance** — views, likes, and profile visits from Shorts

---

## Cost

- **Shutterstock Unlimited**: $199/month (shared with website video needs)
- **Music**: YouTube Audio Library (free) or Epidemic Sound ($15/month)
- **Editing**: DaVinci Resolve (free) or CapCut (free for Shorts)
